# _why spool

_why has been updating a "printer spool" of PCL files on whytheluckystiff.net.
Since this is all ultimately parsable and automatable, I though, "why not?"

## Usage

    $ ./bin/scrape  # download PCL files into src/
    $ ./bin/install # grabs ghostpcl and sets it up
    $ ./bin/build   # build PDFs from PCL files in build/
